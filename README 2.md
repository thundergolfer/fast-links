##### Google Cloud NLP API

Interaction with the GCloud NLP API is handled through the *Node.js Client*. The GCloud project is a `fast-links-extension` project in my GCloud account. ["Cloud Natural Language API Client"](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/libraries) was the article used to get the basics setup.

`app/utils/entity_recognition.js` currently houses the NLP code.
